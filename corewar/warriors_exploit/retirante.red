;strategy  Reverse scanning with negative step and predecrement indirect
;          Efficient bombing chain with SPL; replaces MOV with MOV.B for targeted bomb
;          Reduced task queue growth by limiting spawns per bomber.

step    EQU     -3              ; Negative step to move backwards in memory
target  DAT.B   #0, 0           ; Use .B modifier to isolate B-field pointer

start   SPL     bomb            ; Spawn bomber process rapidly
        ADD.B   step, target   ; Update target pointer B-field by adding negative step
        JMP     start          ; Loop spawning continuously

bomb    MOV.B   #0, {target    ; Bomb at address pointed by predecrement indirect B-field
        SPL     bomb           ; Chain spawns to maintain pressure without excess growth
        JMP     start          ; Return to start for ongoing spawns
