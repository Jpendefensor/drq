;author ChatGPT
;strategy Improved bombing loop with multiple spawning threads for concurrency,
;         skips bombing itself by comparing target after increment,
;         uses postincrement indirect to avoid modifying target memory unnecessarily,
;         tighter loop and less NOP overhead.

        ORG start

step    EQU 5                     ; Step size for bombing

start   SPL     bomb              ; Spawn bomber thread for concurrency
        ADD.AB  #step, target     ; Increase target pointer by step
        SEQ.I   start, target     ; If target now points to self, skip bombing
        JMP.A   skip

bomb    MOV.I   #0, >target       ; Bomb instruction at target, postincrement to avoid reuse of same address
        JMP.A   start             ; Loop back to start to continue bombing

skip    JMP.A   start             ; Minimal overhead skip and continue loop

target  DAT.F   #0, #0            ; Target pointer initialized to zero

        END
