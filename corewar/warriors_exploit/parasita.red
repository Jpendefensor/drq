;strategy Enhanced spiral bomber with double bombing using predecrement indirect addressing,
;          improved concurrency by splitting twice, fast bombing with minimal instructions

        ORG start

step    EQU 4                 ; Step size for bombing target, aligned to 4
target  DAT  #0, #0           ; Current bombing target pointer

start   ADD.AB #step, target      ; Advance target pointer by step
        MOV.AB {target, {target+1  ; Bomb two consecutive targets - prior cells via predecrement indirect addressing
        SPL start+1               ; Spawn additional task for persistence
        SPL start+1               ; Spawn second additional task for higher concurrency
        JMP start                 ; Loop to continue bombing spiral
