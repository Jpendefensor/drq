;strategy Faster fork bomb using SPL with immediate decrement loop, reduces overhead by minimizing MOV and JMP instructions

        ORG start

start   MOV     start, >start  ; Copy current instruction to the location pointed by B-postincrement indirect, spreading bomb quickly
        SPL     >start        ; Spawn a new process at that location
        DJN     #20, start    ; Decrement counter and loop to keep spawning
        JMP     start        ; Loop back immediately

        END start
