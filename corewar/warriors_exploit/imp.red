;strategy Rapidly bomb the opponent's code by jumping every 3rd instruction with faster looping and guaranteed bombing.

        ORG start          ; Start execution here

step    EQU 3               ; Step size for bombing

start   ADD.AB #step, target ; Increment target pointer by step
        MOV.I #0, @target   ; Bomb the instruction at target (using MOV.I to copy whole instruction)
        SPL start           ; Create new task to bomb in parallel, increasing bombing speed
        JMP start           ; Loop back to continue bombing

target  DAT.F #0, #0        ; Pointer to target instruction

        END
