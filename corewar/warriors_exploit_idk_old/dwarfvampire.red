;       Dual-threaded echo bomber with synchronized bombing and pointer increment.
;       Bomb thread uses post-increment indirect addressing to bomb and advance pointer.
;       Increment thread uses pre-decrement indirect addressing on target for tight cycle.
;       Reduced jumps by splitting increment and bomb into two threads, improving speed and survivability.

        ORG start

step    EQU 4              ; step size for bombing interval
target  DAT #0, #0         ; pointer to bomb target

start   SPL bomb            ; spawn bomb thread
        SPL inc             ; spawn increment thread
        JMP start           ; keep main thread alive

bomb    MOV.I  start+2, }target ; bomb target and post-increment pointer
        JMP bomb            ; loop bomb quickly

inc     DJN.A  #step, <target ; pre-decrement target pointer and loop if nonzero
        JMP inc             ; loop increment thread

        END start
