;  Enhanced spiral bomber with optimized bombing and task splitting.
;  Uses post-increment indirect addressing and reduces overhead by minimizing increments.
;  Spawns multiple parallel bombers quickly for higher bombardment density.

        ORG start                ; execution starts here

step    EQU 5                   ; step size for spiral advance
target  DAT #0, #0             ; pointer to target location

start   SPL bomb1               ; spawn first bomber task
        SPL bomb2               ; spawn second bomber task
        ADD.AB #step*2, target  ; advance target by two steps (for two bombers)
        JMP start               ; loop forever

bomb1   MOV.AB #0, >target      ; bomb target, post-increment target pointer
        ADD.AB #step*2, target  ; advance target pointer by two steps to keep spacing
        JMP bomb1               ; loop bombing and advancing

bomb2   MOV.AB #0, >target      ; bomb target, post-increment target pointer
        ADD.AB #step*2, target  ; same stepping as bomb1, offset by one step
        JMP bomb2               ; loop bombing and advancing

        END
