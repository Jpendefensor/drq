;strategy Fast bidirectional replicator with stealthy backward copying and forward bombing for robust defense;
; advances target pointer efficiently and bombs at intervals to disrupt opponents

start   MOV.I   start, {target     ; Copy current instruction backward to target (predecrement A-pointer)
        MOV.I   start+1, {target   ; Copy next instruction backward to target
